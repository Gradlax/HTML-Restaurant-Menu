        <h1> About Us</h1>
        <!-- About page code here -->
        <p> We were started by our store Mom and Pop! 
            After seeing the business models of other industries, we have 
            had to change things around a little bit but we think we have established  
            the perfect restraunt for you and your family or even you and your 
            friends you dare to eat spicy food. 
            Come join us and dine in Hell, for one night only :)
        </p>

        <h3> Holidays </h3>

        <p>We are an institution that prides itself on treating our employees well. This means that any major holiday,
            our restraunt will be closed. We want our work/life balance for our employees to be easily managed. No one should\
            ever have to pick their Work Wife over their actual Wife.

        </p>
